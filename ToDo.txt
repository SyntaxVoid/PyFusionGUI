#### To do ####
1. GUI Framework
    a. Will an analysis of a single probe work? I don't think so.
       Test and remove single channel diagnostics from scan_config(f) if needed.
    b. Ability to run "by-hand" analysis that pinpoints a frequency and time and
       plots probe position vs phase and probe position vs amplitude.
        1. Slightly different for magnetic arrays and ECE.
        2. Ability to chose the metadata you would like to plot. This would generalize
           the plotting routines immensely.
    c. Implement a way of providing different time windows for different shots in the GUI.
       This currently works if you use the console version, but I need to think of a way to
       allow the user to easily specify multiple time windows for each shot.
2. Database
    a. Creation
    b. Manipulation
    c. Statistics
3. Documentation
