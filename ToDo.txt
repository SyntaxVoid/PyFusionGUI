#### To do ####
1. GUI Framework
    a. Will an analysis of a single probe work? I don't think so.
       Test and remove single channel diagnostics from scan_config(f) if needed.
    b. Clean up jtools! Too much repeated code.
    c. Ability to run clustering analysis and plot spectrogram clusters
    d. Ability to run "by-hand" analysis that pinpoints a frequency and time and
       plots probe position vs phase and probe position vs amplitude.
        1. Slightly different for magnetic arrays and ECE.
        2. Ability to chose the metadata you would like to plot. This would generalize
           the plotting routines immensely.
    e: MAJOR. Find out how to close processing windows immediately after
              processing completes. User must close them manually right now.
2. Database
    a. Creation
    b. Manipulation
    c. Statistics
3. Documentation
4. MAJOR: Changed analysis.py so that it gets the magnitudes and FFT results
          within __init__ sloppily. Clean up later.
